                          Currently, only layers with a single tensor input or output

        Args:

            inputs (tensor or tuple of tensors):  Input for which neuron
                        conductance is computed. If forward_func takes a single
                        tensor as input, a single input tensor should be provided.
                        If forward_func takes multiple tensors as input, a tuple
                        of the input tensors should be provided. It is assumed
                        that for all given input tensors, dimension 0 corresponds
                        to the number of examples, and if multiple input tensors
                        are provided, the examples must be aligned appropriately.
            neuron_index (int or tuple): Index of neuron in output of given
                            layer for which attribution is desired. Length of
                            this tuple must be one less than the number of
                            dimensions in the output of the given layer (since
                            dimension 0 corresponds to number of examples).
                            An integer may be provided instead of a tuple of
                            length 1.
            baselines (scalar, tensor, tuple of scalars or tensors, optional):
                        Baselines define the starting point from which integral
                        is computed and can be provided as:

                        - a single tensor, if inputs is a single tensor, with
                          exactly the same dimensions as inputs or the first
                          dimension is one and the remaining dimensions match
                          with inputs.

                        - a single scalar, if inputs is a single tensor, which will
                          be broadcasted for each input value in input tensor.

                        - a tuple of tensors or scalars, the baseline corresponding
                          to each tensor in the inputs' tuple can be:

                          - either a tensor with matching dimensions to
                            corresponding tensor in the inputs' tuple
                            or the first dimension is one and the remaining
                            dimensions match with the corresponding
                            input tensor.

                          - or a scalar, corresponding to a tensor in the
                            inputs' tuple. This scalar value is broadcasted
                            for corresponding input tensor.

                        In the cases when `baselines` is not provided, we internally
                        use zero scalar corresponding to each input tensor.

                        Default: None
            target (int, tuple, tensor or list, optional):  Output indices for
                        which gradients are computed (for classification cases,
                        this is usually the target class).
                        If the network returns a scalar value per example,
                        no target index is necessary.
                        For general 2D outputs, targets can be either:

                        - a single integer or a tensor containing a single
                          integer, which is applied to all input examples

                        - a list of integers or a 1D tensor, with length matching
                          the number of examples in inputs (dim 0). Each integer
                          is applied as the target for the corresponding example.

                        For outputs with > 2 dimensions, targets can be either:

                        - A single tuple, which contains #output_dims - 1
                          elements. This target index is applied to all examples.

                        - A list of tuples with length equal to the number of
                          examples in inputs (dim 0), and each tuple containing
                          #output_dims - 1 elements. Each tuple is applied as the
                          target for the corresponding example.

                        Default: None
            additional_forward_args (any, optional): If the forward function
                        requires additional arguments other than the inputs for
                        which attributions should not be computed, this argument
                        can be provided. It must be either a single additional
                        argument of a Tensor or arbitrary (non-tuple) type or a
                        tuple containing multiple additional arguments including
                        tensors or any arbitrary python types. These arguments
                        are provided to forward_func in order following the
                        arguments in inputs.
                        For a tensor, the first dimension of the tensor must
                        correspond to the number of examples. It will be
                        repeated for each of `n_steps` along the integrated
                        path. For all other types, the given argument is used
                        for all forward evaluations.
                        Note that attributions are not computed with respect
                        to these arguments.
                        Default: None
            n_steps (int, optional): The number of steps used by the approximation
                        method. Default: 50.
            method (string, optional): Method for approximating the integral,
                        one of `riemann_right`, `riemann_left`, `riemann_middle`,
                        `riemann_trapezoid` or `gausslegendre`.
                        Default: `gausslegendre` if no method is provided.
            internal_batch_size (int, optional): Divides total #steps * #examples
                        data points into chunks of size internal_batch_size,
                        which are computed (forward / backward passes)
                        sequentially.
                        For DataParallel models, each batch is split among the
                        available devices, so evaluations on each available
                        device contain internal_batch_size / num_devices examples.
                        If internal_batch_size is None, then all evaluations are
                        processed in one batch.
                        Default: None
            attribute_to_neuron_input (bool, optional): Indicates whether to
                        compute the attributions with respect to the neuron input
                        or output. If `attribute_to_neuron_input` is set to True
                        then the attributions will be computed with respect to
                        neuron's inputs, otherwise it will be computed with respect
                        to neuron's outputs.
                        Note that currently it is assumed that either the input
                        or the output of internal neuron, depending on whether we
                        attribute to the input or output, is a single tensor.
                        Support for multiple tensors will be added later.
                        Default: False

        Returns:
            *tensor* or tuple of *tensors* of **attributions**:
            - **attributions** (*tensor* or tuple of *tensors*):
                        Conductance for
                        particular neuron with respect to each input feature.
                        Attributions will always be the same size as the provided
                        inputs, with each value providing the attribution of the
                        corresponding input index.
                        If a single tensor is provided as inputs, a single tensor is
                        returned. If a tuple is provided for inputs, a tuple of
                        corresponding sized tensors is returned.
