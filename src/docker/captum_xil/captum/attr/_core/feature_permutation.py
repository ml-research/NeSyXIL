class FeaturePermutation(FeatureAblation):
    r"""
    A perturbation based approach to compute attribution, which
    takes each input feature, permutes the feature values within a batch,
    and computes the difference between original and shuffled outputs for
    the given batch. This difference signifies the feature importance
    for the permuted feature.

    Example pseudocode for the algorithm is as follows::

        perm_feature_importance(batch):
            importance = dict()
            baseline_error = error_metric(model(batch), batch_labels)
            for each feature:
                permute this feature across the batch
                error = error_metric(model(permuted_batch), batch_labels)
                importance[feature] = baseline_error - error
                "un-permute" the feature across the batch

            return importance

    It should be noted that the `error_metric` must be called in the
    `forward_func`. You do not need to have an error metric, e.g. you
    could simply return the logits (the model output), but this may or may
    not provide a meaningful attribution.

    This method, unlike other attribution methods, requires a batch
    of examples to compute attributions and cannot be performed on a single example.

    By default, each scalar value within
    each input tensor is taken as a feature and shuffled independently. Passing
    a feature mask, allows grouping features to be shuffled together.
    Each input scalar in the group will be given the same attribution value
    equal to the change in target as a result of shuffling the entire feature
    group.

    The forward function can either return a scalar per example, or a single
    scalar for the full batch. If a single scalar is returned for the batch,
    `perturbations_per_eval` must be 1, and the returned attributions will have
    first dimension 1, corresponding to feature importance across all
    examples in the batch.

        This function is almost equivalent to `FeatureAblation.attribute`. The
        main difference is the way ablated examples are generated. Specifically
        they are generated through the `perm_func`, as we set the baselines for
        `FeatureAblation.attribute` to None.


        Args:
                inputs (tensor or tuple of tensors):  Input for which
                            permutation attributions are computed. If
                            forward_func takes a single tensor as input, a
                            single input tensor should be provided.  If
                            forward_func takes multiple tensors as input, a
                            tuple of the input tensors should be provided. It is
                            assumed that for all given input tensors, dimension
                            0 corresponds to the number of examples (aka batch
                            size), and if multiple input tensors are provided,
                            the examples must be aligned appropriately.
                target (int, tuple, tensor or list, optional):  Output indices for
                            which difference is computed (for classification cases,
                            this is usually the target class).
                            If the network returns a scalar value per example,
                            no target index is necessary.
                            For general 2D outputs, targets can be either:

                            - a single integer or a tensor containing a single
                              integer, which is applied to all input examples

                            - a list of integers or a 1D tensor, with length matching
                              the number of examples in inputs (dim 0). Each integer
                              is applied as the target for the corresponding example.

                            For outputs with > 2 dimensions, targets can be either:

                            - A single tuple, which contains #output_dims - 1
                              elements. This target index is applied to all examples.

                            - A list of tuples with length equal to the number of
                              examples in inputs (dim 0), and each tuple containing
                              #output_dims - 1 elements. Each tuple is applied as the
                              target for the corresponding example.

                            Default: None
                additional_forward_args (any, optional): If the forward function
                            requires additional arguments other than the inputs for
                            which attributions should not be computed, this argument
                            can be provided. It must be either a single additional
                            argument of a Tensor or arbitrary (non-tuple) type or a
                            tuple containing multiple additional arguments including
                            tensors or any arbitrary python types. These arguments
                            are provided to forward_func in order following the
                            arguments in inputs.
                            For a tensor, the first dimension of the tensor must
                            correspond to the number of examples. For all other types,
                            the given argument is used for all forward evaluations.
                            Note that attributions are not computed with respect
                            to these arguments.
                            Default: None
                feature_mask (tensor or tuple of tensors, optional):
                            feature_mask defines a mask for the input, grouping
                            features which should be ablated together. feature_mask
                            should contain the same number of tensors as inputs.
                            Each tensor should be the same size as the
                            corresponding input or broadcastable to match the
                            input tensor. Each tensor should contain integers in
                            the range 0 to num_features - 1, and indices
                            corresponding to the same feature should have the
                            same value.  Note that features within each input
                            tensor are ablated independently (not across
                            tensors).

                            The first dimension of each mask must be 1, as we require
                            to have the same group of features for each input sample.

                            If None, then a feature mask is constructed which assigns
                            each scalar within a tensor as a separate feature, which
                            is permuted independently.
                            Default: None
                perturbations_per_eval (int, optional): Allows permutations
                            of multiple features to be processed simultaneously
                            in one call to forward_fn.  Each forward pass will
                            contain a maximum of perturbations_per_eval * #examples
                            samples.  For DataParallel models, each batch is
                            split among the available devices, so evaluations on
                            each available device contain at most
                            (perturbations_per_eval * #examples) / num_devices
                            samples.
                            If the forward function returns a single scalar per batch,
                            perturbations_per_eval must be set to 1.
                            Default: 1
                **kwargs (Any, optional): Any additional arguments used by child
                            classes of FeatureAblation (such as Occlusion) to construct
                            ablations. These arguments are ignored when using
                            FeatureAblation directly.
                            Default: None

        Returns:
            *tensor* or tuple of *tensors* of **attributions**:
            - **attributions** (*tensor* or tuple of *tensors*):
                        The attributions with respect to each input feature.
                        If the forward function returns
                        a scalar value per example, attributions will be
                        the same size as the provided inputs, with each value
                        providing the attribution of the corresponding input index.
                        If the forward function returns a scalar per batch, then
                        attribution tensor(s) will have first dimension 1 and
                        the remaining dimensions will match the input.
                        If a single tensor is provided as inputs, a single tensor is
                        returned. If a tuple of tensors is provided for inputs,
                        a tuple of corresponding sized tensors is returned.
