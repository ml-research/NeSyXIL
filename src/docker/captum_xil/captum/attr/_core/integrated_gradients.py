class IntegratedGradients(GradientAttribution):
    r"""
    Integrated Gradients is an axiomatic model interpretability algorithm that
    assigns an importance score to each input feature by approximating the
    integral of gradients of the model's output with respect to the inputs
    along the path (straight line) from given baselines / references to inputs.

    Baselines can be provided as input arguments to attribute method.
    To approximate the integral we can choose to use either a variant of
    Riemann sum or Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule.

    More details regarding the integrated gradients method can be found in the
    original paper:

        This method attributes the output of the model with given target index
        (in case it is provided, otherwise it assumes that output is a
        scalar) to the inputs of the model using the approach described above.

        In addition to that it also returns, if `return_convergence_delta` is
        set to True, integral approximation delta based on the completeness
        property of integrated gradients.

        Args:

            inputs (tensor or tuple of tensors):  Input for which integrated
                        gradients are computed. If forward_func takes a single
                        tensor as input, a single input tensor should be provided.
                        If forward_func takes multiple tensors as input, a tuple
                        of the input tensors should be provided. It is assumed
                        that for all given input tensors, dimension 0 corresponds
                        to the number of examples, and if multiple input tensors
                        are provided, the examples must be aligned appropriately.
            baselines (scalar, tensor, tuple of scalars or tensors, optional):
                        Baselines define the starting point from which integral
                        is computed and can be provided as:

                        - a single tensor, if inputs is a single tensor, with
                          exactly the same dimensions as inputs or the first
                          dimension is one and the remaining dimensions match
                          with inputs.

                        - a single scalar, if inputs is a single tensor, which will
                          be broadcasted for each input value in input tensor.

                        - a tuple of tensors or scalars, the baseline corresponding
                          to each tensor in the inputs' tuple can be:

                          - either a tensor with matching dimensions to
                            corresponding tensor in the inputs' tuple
                            or the first dimension is one and the remaining
                            dimensions match with the corresponding
                            input tensor.

                          - or a scalar, corresponding to a tensor in the
                            inputs' tuple. This scalar value is broadcasted
                            for corresponding input tensor.
                        In the cases when `baselines` is not provided, we internally
                        use zero scalar corresponding to each input tensor.

                        Default: None
            target (int, tuple, tensor or list, optional):  Output indices for
                        which gradients are computed (for classification cases,
                        this is usually the target class).
                        If the network returns a scalar value per example,
                        no target index is necessary.
                        For general 2D outputs, targets can be either:

                        - a single integer or a tensor containing a single
                          integer, which is applied to all input examples

                        - a list of integers or a 1D tensor, with length matching
                          the number of examples in inputs (dim 0). Each integer
                          is applied as the target for the corresponding example.

                        For outputs with > 2 dimensions, targets can be either:

                        - A single tuple, which contains #output_dims - 1
                          elements. This target index is applied to all examples.

                        - A list of tuples with length equal to the number of
                          examples in inputs (dim 0), and each tuple containing
                          #output_dims - 1 elements. Each tuple is applied as the
                          target for the corresponding example.

                        Default: None
            additional_forward_args (any, optional): If the forward function
                        requires additional arguments other than the inputs for
                        which attributions should not be computed, this argument
                        can be provided. It must be either a single additional
                        argument of a Tensor or arbitrary (non-tuple) type or a
                        tuple containing multiple additional arguments including
                        tensors or any arbitrary python types. These arguments
                        are provided to forward_func in order following the
                        arguments in inputs.
                        For a tensor, the first dimension of the tensor must
                        correspond to the number of examples. It will be
                        repeated for each of `n_steps` along the integrated
                        path. For all other types, the given argument is used
                        for all forward evaluations.
                        Note that attributions are not computed with respect
                        to these arguments.
                        Default: None
            n_steps (int, optional): The number of steps used by the approximation
                        method. Default: 50.
            method (string, optional): Method for approximating the integral,
                        one of `riemann_right`, `riemann_left`, `riemann_middle`,
                        `riemann_trapezoid` or `gausslegendre`.
                        Default: `gausslegendre` if no method is provided.
            internal_batch_size (int, optional): Divides total #steps * #examples
                        data points into chunks of size internal_batch_size,
                        which are computed (forward / backward passes)
                        sequentially.
                        For DataParallel models, each batch is split among the
                        available devices, so evaluations on each available
                        device contain internal_batch_size / num_devices examples.
                        If internal_batch_size is None, then all evaluations are
                        processed in one batch.
                        Default: None
            return_convergence_delta (bool, optional): Indicates whether to return
                    convergence delta or not. If `return_convergence_delta`
                    is set to True convergence delta will be returned in
                    a tuple following attributions.
                    Default: False
        Returns:
            **attributions** or 2-element tuple of **attributions**, **delta**:
            - **attributions** (*tensor* or tuple of *tensors*):
                    Integrated gradients with respect to each input feature.
                    attributions will always be the same size as the provided
                    inputs, with each value providing the attribution of the
                    corresponding input index.
                    If a single tensor is provided as inputs, a single tensor is
                    returned. If a tuple is provided for inputs, a tuple of
                    corresponding sized tensors is returned.
            - **delta** (*tensor*, returned if return_convergence_delta=True):
                    The difference between the total approximated and true
                    integrated gradients. This is computed using the property
                    that the total sum of forward_func(inputs) -
                    forward_func(baselines) must equal the total sum of the
                    integrated gradient.
                    Delta is calculated per example, meaning that the number of
                    elements in returned delta tensor is equal to the number of
                    of examples in inputs.
