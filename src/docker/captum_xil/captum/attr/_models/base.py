        Since some embedding vectors, e.g. word are created and assigned in
        the embedding layers of Pytorch models we need a way to access
        those layers, generate the embeddings and subtract the baseline.
        To do so, we separate embedding layers from the model, compute the
        embeddings separately and do all operations needed outside of the model.
        The original embedding layer is being replaced by
        `InterpretableEmbeddingBase` layer which passes already
        precomputed embedding vectors to the layers below.

    def forward(self, *inputs, **kwargs):
        r"""
         The forward function of a wrapper embedding layer that takes and returns
         embedding layer. It allows embeddings to be created outside of the model
         and passes them seamlessly to the preceding layers of the model.

         Args:

            *inputs (Any, optional): A sequence of inputs arguments that the
                    forward function takes. Since forward functions can take any
                    type and number of arguments, this will ensure that we can
                    execute the forward pass using interpretable embedding layer.
                    Note that if inputs are specified, it is assumed that the first
                    argument is the embedding tensor generated using the
                    `self.embedding` layer using all input arguments provided in
                    `inputs` and `kwargs`.
            **kwargs (Any, optional): Similar to `inputs` we want to make sure
                    that our forward pass supports arbitrary number and type of
                    key-value arguments. If `inputs` is not provided, `kwargs` must
                    be provided and the first argument corresponds to the embedding
                    tensor generated using the `self.embedding`. Note that we make
                    here an assumption here that `kwargs` is an ordered dict which
                    is new in python 3.6 and is not guaranteed that it will
                    consistently remain that way in the newer versions. In case
                    current implementation doesn't work for special use cases,
                    it is encouraged to override `InterpretableEmbeddingBase` and
                    address those specifics in descendant classes.

         Returns:

            embedding_tensor (Tensor):
                    Returns a tensor which is the same as first argument passed
                    to the forward function.
                    It passes pre-computed embedding tensors to lower layers
                    without any modifications.

                    other variable necessary to comput the embeddings. A typical
                    example of input indices are word or token indices.
